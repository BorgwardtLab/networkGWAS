'''
Function for performing fastlmm snp-set on lists
of SNPs belonging to 1-degree neighbourhoods
constructed starting from each of the permuted
gene-snp mapping.
Through this script it is possible to obtain
the p-values for the permuted network, which then 
will be adjusted using the degree-preserving 
permutation strategy.

NOTE: this script performs the computation of
	  the j-th permutation

Inputs:
- 'data/plink/snp_matrix'                 bem/bim/fim files of the SNPs matrix where there are
										  the SNPs to test, e.g. the SNPs in the neighborhood
										  to test the association with the phenotype

- 'data/plink/phenotype.pheno'            file with the phenotype in plink format

- 'output/permutations/ \
   nb_files/list_nb1_' + j + '.txt':      input file for FaST-LMM-Set function. It is a .txt
										  file having on one column the name of the SNPs, and
										  on the other column the name of the set they belong to. 
										  This has the information about the SNPs obtained by 
										  performing 1-degree aggregation of the SNPs, e.g. each
										  neighborhood is represented by a set of SNPs on the j-th 
										  permuted network

- 'data/gene_name.pkl':   				  numpy vector containing the names of the genes 
										  included in the network

- 'output/permutations/pvalues/ \
   pvalues_' + str(j) + '.pkl':           path where to save the pvalues obtained on the j-th 
   								          permuted network

Command-line arguments:
--test          						  kind of statistical test to be used to obtain the 
										  association score with FaST-LMM-Set function. Could 
										  be either 'lrt' or 'sc-davies'. Default is "lrt". It 
										  should be consistent with what was chosen for the original
										  p-values.

--j                                       index of the permutation for which to launch the FaST-LMM
										  snp-set function. This is done for making it easy to paralle-
										  lise the computation.
